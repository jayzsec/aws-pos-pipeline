# Point of Sale System - Architecture

## Overview

This document describes the architecture of the serverless Point of Sale (POS) system deployed on AWS.

## Components

### Infrastructure

![Architecture Diagram](../assets/architecture.png)

The system uses the following AWS services:

- **Amazon ECS with Fargate**: For running containerized backend services
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Serverless NoSQL database for products and transactions
- **Amazon S3 & CloudFront**: For hosting the frontend application
- **Amazon Cognito**: For authentication and user management
- **Amazon VPC**: Network isolation and security
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitoring and alerting

### Backend

The backend is a Node.js Express application running in AWS Fargate containers:

- RESTful API for product and transaction management
- JWT-based authentication using Cognito
- DynamoDB for persistence
- Auto-scaling based on CPU, memory, and request count

### Frontend

The frontend is a React single-page application:

- Material UI component library for UI elements
- Context-based state management
- Responsive design for both desktop and mobile
- Authentication flow with token refresh

### Data Model

#### Products Table

| Attribute   | Type   | Description                  |
|-------------|--------|------------------------------|
| productId   | String | Primary key                  |
| name        | String | Product name                 |
| price       | Number | Product price                |
| description | String | Product description          |
| category    | String | Product category (GSI)       |
| image       | String | Image URL                    |
| sku         | String | Stock keeping unit           |
| createdAt   | String | Creation timestamp (ISO8601) |
| updatedAt   | String | Update timestamp (ISO8601)   |

#### Transactions Table

| Attribute     | Type   | Description                     |
|---------------|--------|---------------------------------|
| transactionId | String | Primary key                     |
| timestamp     | String | Sort key - Timestamp (ISO8601)  |
| date          | String | Date in YYYY-MM-DD format (GSI) |
| items         | List   | List of purchased items         |
| total         | Number | Total transaction amount        |
| cashierId     | String | Cashier who processed (GSI)     |
| paymentMethod | String | Payment method                  |
| status        | String | Transaction status              |

### Security

- **Network**: VPC with private subnets for containers
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens from Cognito
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control
- **Data**: Encryption in transit and at rest
- **Secrets**: Environment variables for sensitive information

## Deployment

The system uses Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with AWS CDK:

- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated deployments
- **Environments**: Development, Staging, and Production
- **Versioning**: Container images tagged with Git SHA and "latest"
- **Configuration**: Environment-specific config files

## Scalability

The system scales automatically based on:

- **Compute**: Fargate tasks scale based on CPU, memory, and request count
- **Database**: DynamoDB on-demand capacity scales with usage
- **Frontend**: CloudFront distribution handles global traffic

## Monitoring

- **Alarms**: CloudWatch alarms for critical metrics
- **Logging**: Container logs stored in CloudWatch Logs
- **Dashboard**: Custom CloudWatch dashboard for key metrics

## Future Extensions

The architecture supports several extension points:

1. **ML/AI Integration**: 
   - Connect to SageMaker for demand forecasting
   - Use Lambda with DynamoDB Streams for real-time processing

2. **Payment Processing**:
   - Integration with payment gateways via API Gateway

3. **Inventory Management**:
   - Add inventory tracking with stock levels
   - Set up low stock alerts

4. **Reporting**:
   - Connect to QuickSight for advanced analytics
   - Generate scheduled reports via Lambda

5. **Multi-Region Deployment**:
   - Replicate to multiple regions for high availability
   - Use Route 53 for global routing
